# The Server-With-a-PIKVM Project 

In this article I will explain how you can build a server with a KVM using a Raspberry Pi 4 and PiKVM OS. [PiKVM](https://pikvm.org/) is a great open-source project people - including me - have been waiting years for.

## 1.0 Introduction

As the goal of this project is to make it as professional and replicable as possible, you will definitely need:

- Interest and motivation
- A great amount of time
- Not too less money

## 2.0 Requirements

- Raspberry Pi 4

  - In order to control both the keyboard and the mouse of the server, we will need a Raspberry Pi which offers USB On-The-Go (OTG). This way, the Raspberry will act as an external USB device and will simulate a keyboard, mouse (and mass storage for images):

    The default name is "PiKVM CD-ROM Drive 0515".
  
    Following Raspberry Pis offer OTG:
    
     - [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero/) via Micro-USB
     - [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/) via Micro-USB
     - [Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/) via Micro-USB
     - [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) via USB-C
    
    Following do **not** offer it and therefore are not recommended:
    
     - Raspberry Pi Pico
     - Raspberry Pi Pico W
     - Raspberry Pi 1 Model A
     - Raspberry Pi 1 Model A+
     - Raspberry Pi 1 Model B
     - Raspberry Pi 1 Model B+
     - Raspberry Pi 2 Model B
     - Raspberry Pi 2 Model B V1.2
     - Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+
     - Raspberry Pi 3 Model B
     - Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+

- 3D printer: Reliable and cheap is a FLSUN Q5.

  - **PCTG Filament**: You will also need a special filament. While PLA is a great filament, this is not what we want in our case. Instead, we will use a special PCTG filament which not only is more temperature stable (about 80-90 ¬∞C), but also offers flame-retardant properties according to [UL94 V2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UL_94). Still, it is very unlikely that anything will ever happen ‚Äì but having anything easily inflammable in a server is never good practice.

    - Extrudr PCTG, 1.75 mm, 0.8 kg<br>

  - **Polyimide Tape**: While you don't need a 3D printer with a closed chamber, it can be hard to print PCTG to the surface. Therefore, you will need Polyimide tape (also known as "Kapton").
