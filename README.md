# The Server-With-a-PiKVM Project 

In this article I will explain how you can build a server with a KVM using a Raspberry Pi 4 and PiKVM OS.

[PiKVM](https://pikvm.org/) is a great open-source project people - including me - have been waiting years for. While the documentation is a bit in need of improvement, Maxim Devaev, the creator and main developer of PiKVM, is always very helpful.

## 1.0 Introduction

As the goal of this project is to make it as professional and replicable as possible, you will definitely need:

- Interest and motivation.
- A great amount of time.
- Not too less money.
