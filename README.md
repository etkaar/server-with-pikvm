# The Server-With-a-PiKVM Project 

In this article I will explain how you can build a server with a KVM using a Raspberry Pi 4 and PiKVM OS.

[PiKVM](https://pikvm.org/) is a great open-source project people - including me - have been waiting years for. An alternative solution is [TinyPilot](https://github.com/tiny-pilot/tinypilot), they use work of PiKVM though (e.g. [pikvm/ustreamer](https://github.com/tiny-pilot/ustreamer)). Both projects are open-source but also offer pre-assambled devices.

## 1.0 Introduction

As the goal of this project is to make it as professional and replicable as possible, you will definitely need:

- Interest and motivation.
- A great amount of time.
- Not too less money.

### üôá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Side Note: Beware the Moderators**

While Maxim Devaev, the creator and main developer of PiKVM, is always kind and helpful, the moderators (Arch1mede and Amt921) on the Discord server are kind of aggressive. Polemical statements, unnecessarily warnings for trivialities are the order of the day. It is not unlikely to get banned on their Discord server ‚Äì I also got banned after I shared my work.
