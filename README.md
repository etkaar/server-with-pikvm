# The Server-With-a-PiKVM Project 

**üü• I ended this project because the moderators (Arch1mede and Amt921) on the Discord server are kind of aggressive. Polemical statements, unnecessarily warnings for trivialities are the order of the day. After I shared this work, I got permanently banned. Thus, there is no reason to further support PiKVM. Anyway, I will try to help if you have questions. üü•**

In this article I will explain how you can build a server with a KVM using a Raspberry Pi 4 and PiKVM OS.

[PiKVM](https://pikvm.org/) is a great open-source project people - including me - have been waiting years for. An alternative solution is [TinyPilot](https://github.com/tiny-pilot/tinypilot), they use work of PiKVM though (e.g. [pikvm/ustreamer](https://github.com/tiny-pilot/ustreamer)). Both projects are open-source but also offer pre-assambled devices.

## 1.0 Introduction

As the goal of this project is to make it as professional and replicable as possible, you will definitely need:

- Interest and motivation.
- A great amount of time.
- Not too less money.
